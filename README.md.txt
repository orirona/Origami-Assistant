Origami Assistant
This is a project of the Computational Origami Group of the Western Connecticut State University Computer Science Department, started in December 2017. Members of the group are Rona Gurkewitz, Director, Robert Buckley, research assistant and Nghiep K Luu, origami artist.
The software is envisioned to be a voice controlled origami simulator, or folding  program. It involves creating a language for directing the folding of paper using voice commands and implementing it as well as software to display the folding steps graphically. A slideshow of folding steps will also be created, and each step will be annotated with the folding instruction given to achieve that step. Input will be in FOLD file format and output will be in FOLD and OBJ formats.
